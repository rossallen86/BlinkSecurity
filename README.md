# Blink Security API Client (.NET)

**.NET Client for making calls to the Blink Security API**

This library provides to the best of my knowledge, full coverage of the Blink Home Security API based on the [documentation](https://github.com/MattTW/BlinkMonitorProtocol) . Project includes a wrapper service that handles mapping all major endpoints and entities to C#-friendly objects.
