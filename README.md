# Blink Security API Client (.NET)

This library provides to the best of my knowledge, full coverage of the Blink Home Security API based on the [documentation](https://github.com/MattTW/BlinkMonitorProtocol) . Project includes a mappper for all major endpoints and entities to C#-friendly objects, as well as a service wrapper still being built in conjunction with another project.
